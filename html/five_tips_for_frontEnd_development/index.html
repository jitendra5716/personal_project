        Don’t you just love exploring beautiful and neat sites with a clean user
        interface? While most of us would reply with an assertive ‘YES,’ little,
        do we know the kind of effort and skill that goes into making a website
        attractive and user-friendly. The secret to creating an impressive site
        is to master the art of front-end development, and no, it is not as easy
        as it seems!
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it is not impossible either. Here are five tips that’ll help
        you get better in front-end design and web development.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>Automate!</h4>
          <p>
            As a front-end developer, you already have to take care of minute
            little details that can get overwhelming at times. You have to
            invest your time on things like Boilerplate, testing, workflow,
            dependency management, performance, optimization, build, deployment,
            and so on. Doesn’t sound easy, right?
          </p>
          <p>
            Take some steam off yourself and incorporate automation into your
            workflow. While automation can take care of things such as
            optimization, testing, etc., you can focus on the core areas of
            front-end development such as HTML, CSS, creating the client-side
            software, enhancing the user-experience, and so on. By doing so, not
            only will your productivity increase, but you will also learn to use
            your time to focus on the areas that’ll improve the overall
            functionality of your site. Grunt, Gulp, and Broccoli are some very
            efficient automation tools.
          </p>

          <h4>Refactor Your Code From Time To Time.</h4>
          <p>
            By “refactoring” your code, you’re only enhancing the code without
            tampering with its functionality. This will improve the quality and
            readability quotient of your code and the more often you do it, your
            code will continually be updated into a cleaner and fresher version
            of what it was before. Apart from that, one of the most significant
            advantages that refactoring offers is that it ensures your code
            remains free from plagiarism.
          </p>

          <h4>Learning Command Line Is The Way To Go</h4>
          <p>
            It is a standard convention among developers to use GUI tools to
            power the terminal. What most of them don’t realize is that by doing
            so, they end up spending a significant portion of their valuable
            time in handling GUI tools than making progress on the terminal. The
            right way to go about it is learning the command line. Start with
            the basics of the command line and advance to higher levels as you
            go, and you’ll find that you can complete several tasks with much
            more ease and efficiency with command line tools than with GUI
            tools. Moreover, automating the terminal with appropriate commands
            is a great way to save time and energy.

          <h4>Invest In Productive Tools.</h4>
          <p>
            The Internet is teeming with a host of web development tools, from
            browser add-ons to smart plugins, the amount of choices available
            now is massive! So, why not invest in some really productive web
            tools that’ll help you improve your front-end designing skills?
            Tools like Sublime Text, jQuery, Emmet, GitHub, Bootstrap, and Sass
            are nothing short of a godsend for web developers.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Always Be Curious.</h4>
          <p>
            A front-end developer has to keep himself/herself updated
            continuously with the latest news and innovations in the field. You
            need to take a proactive stand and learn new things about front-end
            development from informative blogs and videos.
